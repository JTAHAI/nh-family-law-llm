## Full-suite limitation

The repository contains several intentionally expensive evidence and full-GA tests. A single monolithic run exceeded this execution environment's command ceiling. Completed deterministic groups showed no assertion failures, but this report does not claim that all 676 tests completed in one uninterrupted invocation.

## Required Windows validation not run

- Signed MSIX build
- Windows App Certification Kit
- Windows PowerShell parser test

Those require the Windows release environment.
