# New Hampshire Family Law LLM v3.3.0 Completion Report

v3.3.0 upgrades the local chat and intake layer without weakening the product's source-first and review-required rules.

## Completed

- Rebuilt intake routing around explicit safety precedence and negation-aware phrase handling.
- Added neutral extraction of requested actions, labeled dates, routing reasons, attention level, confidence, and truncation disclosure.
- Added visible date/deadline review language in the structured chat response and compatibility text renderer.
- Extended source-card follow-up to New Hampshire-law, private-record, and combined answers.
- Added stale-reference, missing-session, expired-state, and out-of-range failure paths.
- Added bounded, in-memory-only, session-scoped source continuity with a 30-minute expiry.
- Rotated and cleared source state when a user starts a new chat.
- Hardened the local API with no-store headers, request IDs, same-origin isolation headers, input bounds, and sanitized error responses.
- Bumped the source and Store package target to 3.3.0 / 3.3.0.0.
- Added regression tests and release evidence.

## Validation

- Full suite: **648 passed, 1 skipped (649 collected)**.
- Focused release suite: **58 passed**.
- FOCAF assets: **103/103 resolved with matching hashes**.
- Local doctor, release artifact audit, public-source readiness, Python compilation, and JavaScript syntax all passed.

## Not claimed

No signed MSIX was produced and WACK was not run in this Linux environment. The source package remains review-required legal-information software, not production legal GA evidence.
