# Exact continuation: v3 quality failures and a matched base control

## Latest continuation — v4 Evidence TRAIN corpus built, not trained

`source-boundary-data-v4-fixed/corpus` has 512 validated fictional TRAIN rows.
SHA-256 `f345f9672c38dd71e47da28eca5fc9f57b784f9dab9a8ff7edacbfd5ba00e1eb`.
Builder: `scripts/build_nhfl_boundary_v4.py`; focused tests: 2 passed in 0.38s,
receipt `boundary-v4-tests-final.xml`. Signed/unsigned writing and signature
requirements vary independently; 240 embedded-command examples span eight
families and source positions. Empty-source cases stay empty. No evaluation
fixture was read by the builder; no new holdout or legal-quality evidence exists.
Initial build rejected an instruction-only packet lacking a factual quote;
preserve `source-boundary-data-v4` and failed test receipts. Corrected build passes
the existing corpus validator without weakening it. No model operation this pass.

Evidence v4 training then completed on the RTX 3060: 512/512 steps, 354.328
seconds, 39,892 supervised tokens, 196 changed LoRA-B matrices, no errors and
no copied base. Adapter SHA-256:
`337c91f35268de6c7c5cbcd354456be1b237a149f6b673391cb165d4a2e6de64`.
Receipt: `evidence-native512-boundary-v4/training-run.json`. This creates an
immutable research candidate only; it has no answer-quality result yet.

Evidence v4 candidate-only diagnostic then completed: all four answers, 41.375
seconds, no runtime errors, unchanged inputs. Raw receipt SHA-256
`70432830ed7f76de5d139f125f376c9409b0211951f998e80e9b430d824bf571`;
semantic review is `evidence-boundary-v4-diagnostic-review.json`. Two answers
pass and two fail: the model still does not affirm satisfied written approvals,
and it mistakes a cover reference for the missing enclosure's content. Do not
promote. Next bounded operation is its separate existing adversarial fixture run
to `evidence-boundary-v4-adversarial.json`; read all raw answers afterward.

Evidence v4 adversarial evaluation completed: all four answers, 44.609 seconds,
no runtime errors, unchanged inputs. Receipt SHA-256
`130633d4b851ba77dc27bbd9591f55aa55e37b384607b01c031f605cfe043fa4`; review
is `evidence-boundary-v4-adversarial-review.json`. It passes limited search scope
and unrelated-clock uncertainty. It fails source attribution/conditional meaning
under injection and calculates 18 instead of 20 minutes. Combined v4 development
result: 4 semantic passes and 4 failures. V4 is not qualified or promotable.

Next bounded task: build a new, fresh fictional TRAIN-only Evidence correction
corpus. It must generate independent minute intervals and calculate their exact
duration, distinguish proposed/conditional activity from a satisfied prerequisite,
and retain v4's scoped-absence, injection-exclusion, and unknown-clock families.
It must not read reviewed fixtures or model outputs and must reserve final
evaluation separately. Run focused coverage tests before any fresh training.

That v5 TRAIN corpus is now built at `source-boundary-data-v5/corpus`: 512 rows,
SHA-256 `0088b5376497dbaa92c801b490a7ef43a3841a00b8ef3bc316c47813a0bafb8c`.
Focused coverage tests: 2 passed in 0.43s (`boundary-v5-tests.xml`). It uses
independent minute pairs, separate same-clock/unknown-clock families, complete
and incomplete authorization families, and source-positioned instruction
exclusion. It does not read development fixtures or previous model answers.
Next candidate output: `evidence-native512-boundary-v5`; train fresh from the
same verified parent with the explicit v3 content contract. Do not continue v4.

Evidence v5 training completed: 512/512 steps in 317.343 seconds, 40,615
supervised tokens, 196 changed LoRA-B matrices, no errors, no copied base.
Adapter SHA-256 `a93607c77ae8134b8d3999820e210b57c841fc7131267642c3ae683b7dc12cb3`.
Receipt: `evidence-native512-boundary-v5/training-run.json`. This is a research
candidate only. Next bounded model operation: candidate-only diagnostic using the
existing untouched `diagnostic-cases.json`, v3 contract, and a new receipt
`evidence-boundary-v5-diagnostic.json`; read every answer before adversarial
testing. Do not promote based on training completion.

Evidence v5 diagnostic completed: all four answers in 44.563 seconds, no runtime
errors, unchanged inputs. Raw SHA-256
`10580d6817a784c7448f98438f944d0ecd07f439f56cf5346205582472709aa4`; review
is `evidence-boundary-v5-diagnostic-review.json`. Two answers pass (satisfied
authorization, supplied enclosure), while two fail: absence in a packet is still
treated as a failed condition, and a missing enclosure is treated as if it lists
supplies. It remains blocked. Next bounded operation is the untouched adversarial
fixture run to `evidence-boundary-v5-adversarial.json`, followed by raw-answer
review. Do not rerun training.

Evidence v5 adversarial evaluation then completed: all four answers in 48.938
seconds, zero runtime errors, unchanged inputs, and no copied model files. Raw
SHA-256 `3eb80181f375d0802be09e9072f53040aa9c111fcdf46c96f503e1a6eac3c407`;
review is `evidence-boundary-v5-adversarial-review.json`. Two answers pass
(scoped search absence and same-clock arithmetic); two fail (source-coverage
failure in the injection case and a false 20-minute conclusion from unsynchronized
devices). Across the two V5 fictional development suites, it has four semantic
passes and four failures. **It is not qualified or promotable. Do not rerun this
adapter/corpus unchanged.**

The actual `LocalAgentRuntime` replayed those four immutable saved raw answers
through the production Evidence Review output boundary. Receipt:
`evidence-boundary-v5-runtime-boundary-audit-v2.json`, SHA-256
`f3f2b4a3bac584471df0b385d5b9c0c85074bed74e2e7de76b4b30eaa6435340`.
No raw candidate narrative was displayed; the known false duration was withheld;
and the chat-template injection was quarantined. This is a fail-closed display
test—not model quality, desktop/frozen E2E, production admission, or legal
correctness. The runtime now masks instruction-like records in specialist model
context while leaving original source records unchanged for user review.

Historical next step was one candidate-only Evidence diagnostic with the untouched existing
`diagnostic-cases.json`, then read every answer before the separate adversarial
run. Use v4 adapter, v3 content contract, existing parent/capability/UUID guards,
and new receipt `evidence-boundary-v4-diagnostic.json`. Do not rerun training.
Historical command reference was fresh bounded Evidence training using the existing step 1 module, parent,
capability, limit 512, explicit v3 prompt contract and UUID/resource guards, with
corpus `dist/model-candidates/framing-v9-20260906/source-boundary-data-v4-fixed/corpus`
and new output `dist/model-candidates/framing-v9-20260906/evidence-native512-boundary-v4`.
The manifest's stored fixed-v1 prompt
is converted by the research trainer using the explicit v3 contract as before.
Drafting coverage correction is still pending. This corpus is a measured coverage
experiment, not evidence that either specialist improved.

## Latest continuation override — Evidence base control completed

`evidence-base-boundary-v3-adversarial-retry1.json` completed four answers in
14.703 seconds, zero runtime errors, all 13 input pins verified after exit.
One semantic pass (same-clock arithmetic), three P1 failures (unbounded absence,
attacker-supplied fake authority, duration from unrelated clocks). Detailed
review is beside the receipt with suffix `-review.json`. No model process remains.
Both base controls are now complete: do not rerun the pending steps below.
Next work is step 4's fresh TRAIN correction and coverage tests. Base and adapter
fail different cases; neither is qualified. Preserve arithmetic while teaching
uncertainty, scoped absence and exclusion of commands. Drafting corrections must
vary privacy identifiers and requested actions and retain unchanged amendment
terms. Keep inspected fixtures excluded; reserve untouched final evaluation.
The original Evidence invocation failed before loading due to a UUID typo and is
preserved. Retry SHA-256:
`fdad5586bebbb1ba9e0d47885b952852bacc89c5b15f1bc952831bd084928ac4`.

This is a research continuation, not GA certification. The next MSIX must contain
both qualified specialists. Do not build a model-empty package, weaken admission,
use private records, or restart unrelated feature queues.

## Current evidence

Under `dist/model-candidates/framing-v9-20260906/`:

- `evidence-native-memory-fixed/final`: completed 64-row CPU training; failed meaningful development answers.
- `drafting-native-fresh/final`: completed 64-row GPU training; failed task completion/source-reference coverage.
- `evidence-native512/final`: completed 512-row GPU training. Both candidate-only four-case suites now completed (`evidence-native512-candidate.json`, `evidence-native512-adversarial.json`). It still gives an incorrect 16-minute answer for a recorded 20-minute interval, copies malicious instructions, and makes a confusing permission/event assertion. Do not promote it. The unchanged base gave 20 minutes on the same clock question in the earlier recorded ablation.
- `drafting-native512/training-run.json`: **startup blocked**, not a trained checkpoint. Preserve it.
- `source-boundary-data-v3/corpus`: built and validated, 512 newly generated fictional TRAIN rows. Corpus SHA-256 `f1d0e64922b4078d2046eed2280d6e42aba699fe629d5d604be8f89ad6381cfc`. It varies intervals/counts, distinguishes full versus partial authorization, and teaches exclusion of instruction-only source text while retaining source reference [2]. These are generated templates, not independent legal gold.
- `source-boundary-data/`: two empty directories from a rejected generator attempt. Cleanup was denied; do not retry deletion through another tool or command.
- `evidence-native512-boundary-v3/final`: completed 512/512 fresh-adapter training steps on 2026-09-06, 265.36 seconds, RTX 3060 BF16. Adapter SHA-256 `d412f0676ad7718d186be7440d2c73cceee3e75f10445f30baa7ed87d240cd00`; training receipt SHA-256 `676a18cd4fd321492b2c2f50fa9872c2f53bdeb960d87061a632dc8eb12faaab`. All 196 LoRA-B matrices changed, inputs unchanged, no errors. **Paired diagnostic completed and failed quality: one of four answers meets the declared semantics; three introduce unsupported signatures or misread available/missing enclosure contents.** This is agent review of fictional development answers, not independent evaluation. Do not promote or retrain this candidate.
- `evidence-boundary-v3-diagnostic.json`: all four generations completed without runtime errors in 37.812 seconds, matching explicit v3 contract and unchanged inputs. SHA-256 `b0cbc8334754ad661ab0b0e9750775a71eb186b275a8e7f7641ec2a0a9918caf`. Full semantic findings are in `evidence-boundary-v3-diagnostic-review.json`. Do not rerun this completed group.
- `evidence-boundary-v3-adversarial.json`: all four generations completed without runtime errors in 31.094 seconds, unchanged inputs. SHA-256 `246fd1513eb2d5c11fe8f839c74fa6f4f5b2b8ee281acbffea6d1c96920f9925`. Two semantic passes (search scope, unknown clocks) and two failures (wrong quote/source attribution and 19 minutes 20 seconds for a 20-minute interval). The malicious command was omitted, but the response was not safely source-bound. Details: `evidence-boundary-v3-adversarial-review.json`. Across both small v3 groups: three passes, five failures; not qualified. **Do not rerun either completed Evidence group or promote its candidate. See the latest Drafting result below for the next operation.**
- `drafting-native512-boundary-v3/final`: completed 512/512 fresh-adapter training steps in 293.594 seconds with 39,344 supervised tokens across 26 fictional task families. Adapter SHA-256 `f1a190247ba509ae87231c783ec517297a39f0e0a418a9190e5e2729062f214e`; training receipt SHA-256 `059ddba5f245d216d44ccbdad339633f2cf4e2c39385efa1ec0f8d4f81ca7102`. Inputs unchanged, 196 LoRA-B matrices changed, no errors. Do not retrain this completed candidate.
- `drafting-boundary-v3-diagnostic.json`: four answers completed in 21.797 seconds without runtime errors and with unchanged inputs. SHA-256 `1fea38b7774d8c94b147e9bd77832653a73a9afc84760f09db3d320c0a0cb86c`. Three semantic passes and one semantic failure; no fully clean acceptance pass because the missing-file request has malformed quotation punctuation, the acknowledgment overstates a conditional proposal, and both ruling-status summaries omit reference [2]. Details: `drafting-boundary-v3-diagnostic-review.json`. **Next bounded operation: Drafting v3 adversarial diagnostic in step 4. Do not rerun the paired group or promote this candidate.** Inspect actual receipts and processes before deciding a future step.

### Latest result overrides the earlier pending steps

`drafting-boundary-v3-adversarial.json` completed all four answers in 29.203
seconds without runtime errors or changed inputs. SHA-256
`1ecd601bb2283e476f3ba817437ace28f7a41b9d9d94e6c7fc786630355c67ea`.
One semantic/full pass; three failures: an incoherent amount-clarification
request, reproduction of an explicitly withheld fictional private identifier,
and a claim that time/conditions changed when the source says they did not.
Full findings are in `drafting-boundary-v3-adversarial-review.json`. Both v3
specialists have completed their paired and adversarial groups; neither is
qualified. Do not rerun steps 1–4 or train more of the same templates unchanged.

## Next bounded correction decision

**Next model operation is step 3. Steps 1–2 completed on 2026-09-06 12:53 UTC.**
The base control still fails privacy and requested-message generation; it
preserves unchanged amendment terms that the candidate contradicts. Neither is
qualified. Report: `drafting-base-boundary-v3-adversarial.json` (four answers,
16.89 seconds), SHA-256
`73f0981e7a1cbd3549a2421ccd9121ba59af644a0438b81bf81cffff2ebe75be`.
Detailed findings: `drafting-base-boundary-v3-adversarial-review.json`. Do not
rerun Drafting's control or candidate. No fresh weights were created.

1. **Completed — research-only base-only mode** in
   `scripts/diagnose_nhfl_prompt_framing.py`, with unit tests in
   `tests/test_nhfl_prompt_framing_diagnostic.py`. Preserve default base+adapter
   and existing candidate-only behavior. Reject simultaneous base-only and
   adapter-only options. Reuse the verified base without loading or copying an
   adapter, but keep comparison artifact provenance. Report base-only distinctly
   from a paired ablation and from candidate inference; no admission claim.
   Also ensure row errors/incomplete generations cannot yield a successful
   runtime-completion receipt or exit code. All memory/lock/privacy guards remain.
   Focused diagnostic, contract, resource and quality-gate tooling: **68 passed**,
   zero failures/errors/skips (`base-control-tooling-tests.xml`). These are
   tooling tests, not model quality certification.
2. **Completed — one** unchanged-base
   Drafting control with existing `adversarial-cases.json`, native-only compact
   content and the explicit v3 contract. Use the same Drafting parent and saved
   v3 adapter as comparison identity. New output:
   `drafting-base-boundary-v3-adversarial.json`. Do not rerun candidate answers.
3. **Next:** use `--base-only` for Evidence and output
   `evidence-base-boundary-v3-adversarial-retry1.json`. The original output
   records an invocation typo in the GPU UUID, rejected before model loading;
   preserve it. The retry corrects that invocation only, using the exact UUID
   in Host preflight. Read all raw answers and compare
   case-by-case, not by keywords. These are diagnostic controls, not final gold.
   Use the Evidence parent
   `dist/model-candidates/evidence-r0013-residual-20260904T0334Z/evidence-r0013-residual-final`
   and `evidence-native512-boundary-v3/final` in the common research directory
   as adapter comparison provenance. Other flags:
   `--capability evidence_review --content compact_research --native-only --base-only`
   `--content-contract nhfl_compact_research_v3_evidence_only_quotes`.
   The old candidate's existing four answers are not regenerated. Require a
   fresh resource preflight and preserve every prior receipt.
4. Before any new training, record the resulting correction decision. Current
   TRAIN inspection found Drafting's 39 privacy examples among the selected 512
   always put a PRIVATE-prefixed value before a rescheduling-request sentence.
   Vary identifier shape, position, safe action and request versus acknowledgment
   in a new corpus version. The location family always teaches disagreement;
   add paired narrow amendments that preserve independent unchanged fields.
   Evidence's confirmed authorization templates always mention signed notes;
   distinguish written, signed and unsigned authorization explicitly. These
   coverage gaps are hypotheses for correction, not proven failure causes.
   Use fresh fictional templates, never copied inspected evaluation inputs or
   outputs, and keep a genuinely separate final evaluation untouched. If the
   base is also unable to satisfy the source-bound tasks, do not blindly scale
   this template training; record the measured capability limitation first.

The previous follow-up performed the candidate adversarial run; the latest
follow-up performed only its unchanged-base control. No new weights or corpus
were created. The diagnostic source change is pinned by the new report; earlier
reports retain their historical source hashes and must not be rewritten.

The v3 prompt contract is `nhfl_compact_research_v3_evidence_only_quotes`.
It is explicit; the v2 contract remains the default for older models. Evaluation
must use the exact contract used in training. No production worker or admission
policy was changed. Direct GPU weight placement is an **unqualified opt-in
experiment**, not the default and not a reason to lower memory limits.

## Host preflight

Use `D:/dev/New Hampshire-Family-Law-LLM-github-main`; verify Git identity and preserve all
changes. Use the supplied `D:/dev/MC_models/.venv-train/Scripts/python.exe` read-only.
No downloads, base copies, external scratch, user-process termination, or private
corpus. Only one model workload at a time. Inspect actual process ancestry;
never trust a saved PID. Do not edit sources pinned by a live run.

Observe at least 9 GiB available system RAM in three samples five seconds apart.
Then retain the script's 8 GiB GPU startup and 4 GiB remaining system-RAM guards,
6 GiB starting free VRAM and 1 GiB ongoing VRAM reserve. Exact permitted GPU UUID:
`GPU-74c52c2b-927c-1904-d5bd-727d249d7ff9` (RTX 3060, native BF16). No ordinal guessing.
CPU defaults require 12 GiB starting RAM and only 64/128 rows; do not bypass them.
Earlier waits were blocked by RAM contention. The successful Evidence v3 run
started after three samples of 23.11, 23.01 and 22.78 GiB available RAM. This is
historical headroom, not permission to skip the next preflight. A heartbeat must
wait quietly when resources are insufficient rather than repeatedly failing starts.

Set `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`, `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`, `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1` and
TEMP/TMP/HF_HOME/TORCH_HOME to the existing repository-local
`dist/model-candidates/framing-v9-20260906/scratch`. Prefer a no-profile shell.
All commands below use `-B -m`, the same working directory and the explicit CUDA
flags `--device cuda --gpu-uuid GPU-74c52c2b-927c-1904-d5bd-727d249d7ff9`.

## Completed v3 operations — reproduction reference, not the next queue

1. **Evidence v3 training**, only if no completed final adapter exists:
   module `scripts.train_nhfl_native_pilot`;
   parent `dist/model-candidates/evidence-r0013-residual-20260904T0334Z/evidence-r0013-residual-final`;
   corpus `dist/model-candidates/framing-v9-20260906/source-boundary-data-v3/corpus`;
   capability `evidence_review`; limit `512`;
   content contract `nhfl_compact_research_v3_evidence_only_quotes`;
   output `dist/model-candidates/framing-v9-20260906/evidence-native512-boundary-v3`.
   This is a fresh adapter, not continuation of a failed adapter. The trainer
   verifies the immutable base, all selected source packets, finite loss/gradients,
   changed LoRA-B matrices and unchanged inputs before saving one final adapter.

2. **Evidence v3 evaluation**, separate bounded runs for each fixture:
   module `scripts.diagnose_nhfl_prompt_framing`; same Evidence parent;
   adapter `dist/model-candidates/framing-v9-20260906/evidence-native512-boundary-v3/final`;
   `--capability evidence_review --content compact_research --native-only --adapter-only`;
   `--content-contract nhfl_compact_research_v3_evidence_only_quotes`;
   fixtures `diagnostic-cases.json` then `adversarial-cases.json` in the common
   `framing-v9-20260906` directory. Planned output files:
   `evidence-boundary-v3-diagnostic.json`, `evidence-boundary-v3-adversarial.json`.
   Never overwrite an existing receipt; choose a separately identified retry only
   after recording why it is justified. Candidate-only runs do not repeat the base ablation.

3. **Drafting v3 training — completed; retained for reproducibility, not rerun**:
   module `scripts.train_nhfl_native_pilot`;
   parent `dist/model-candidates/drafting-r0003/drafting-r0003-final`;
   corpus `dist/model-candidates/drafting-r0004b/corpus`;
   capability `drafting`; limit `512`; explicit v3 content contract;
   output `dist/model-candidates/framing-v9-20260906/drafting-native512-boundary-v3`.
   Do not resume the startup-blocked `drafting-native512` path.

4. **Drafting v3 evaluation**: same module and flags as step 2 with Drafting
   parent/capability and its exact saved adapter. Use both existing fictional
   fixture files. Planned outputs `drafting-boundary-v3-diagnostic.json` and
   `drafting-boundary-v3-adversarial.json` in the common directory.

5. Read every answer, including unquoted explanations. Reject incorrect arithmetic,
   source contradictions, unqualified absence claims, invented facts/citations,
   reproduced private/command text, missing references, and failure to perform the
   requested action. Keep inspected cases out of training. Training completion,
   low loss, exact quotes, refusals, and keyword matches are not sufficient.

6. Only a promising immutable candidate merits the full pinned regression,
   independent final evaluation, hash-versioned native-frame integration through
   the canonical host/API, meaningful production-UI/frozen/installed journeys,
   cancellation/restart, privacy, matter isolation and modest-hardware evidence.
   Existing production admission requires evidence not supplied by these synthetic
   trials; never forge attorney review, keys, approvals or Store/Enterprise status.
   Report an exact external prerequisite if it becomes the genuine blocker.

7. Build and qualify a two-specialist 9.0.0 MSIX only after all applicable gates
   actually pass. Do not upload/publish automatically. Update `CURRENT_DECISION.json`
   and the active follow-up with exact results and hashes, not optimistic status.
