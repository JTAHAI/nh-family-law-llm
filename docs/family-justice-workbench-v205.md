# Family Justice Workbench v2.05

The Family Justice Workbench is a deterministic New Hampshire family-law packet builder for local review workflows. It accepts a question, audience, procedural posture, optional context, and requested output style, then returns a structured packet with:

- answer preview and plain-language answer
- issue labels and posture label
- urgency and safety routing
- source cards and authority matrix preview
- legal caveats, missing information, and next-best-action planning
- red flags and filing-gate blocker explanations
- reviewer handoff and export metadata

It supports parent, caregiver, lawyer, counselor, therapist, and reviewer pathways. Counselor and therapist outputs use professional-boundary language and do not provide legal strategy.

## Not Legal Advice

The workbench is legal information and workflow support only. It does not create an attorney-client relationship, does not certify current law, and does not mark anything filing-ready. Official New Hampshire authority and verified source-registry data outrank model memory, summaries, mirrors, and snippets.

All outputs default to `review_required`. Filing readiness remains blocked unless official-source freshness, authority, citation, quote-span, claim-support, form, posture, jurisdiction, and human-review gates pass.
