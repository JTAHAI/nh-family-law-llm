# New Hampshire Family Law LLM v5.19.0 — GA Shipment Readiness

v5.19.0 adds a fail-closed Pass 51 operations layer for preparing and independently auditing the final shipment manifest.

## Added

- Immutable shipment identity bound to source ZIP and Pass 50 evidence hashes.
- Fourteen-artifact GA shipment inventory.
- Ten evidence-bound GA-definition controls.
- Source, Microsoft Store, and enterprise-managed release-channel records.
- Qualification, rollback, distribution-reference, and receipt hashing.
- P0-P3 shipment blocker lifecycle.
- Deterministic ship/no-ship evaluation using `GAShipmentAuditor`.
- Immutable JSON, HTML, receipt, and manifest evidence packet.
- Nine bounded local API routes and integrated workbench controls.

## Safety boundary

The application always reports `pass51_complete: false`. A clean software-side evaluation is `ready_for_external_pass51_gate`, not a claim that GA shipped.
