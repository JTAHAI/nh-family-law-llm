# New Hampshire Family Law LLM v3.3.0 Test Summary

## Release identity

- Product version: **3.3.0**
- Microsoft Store package target: **3.3.0.0**
- UI identity: **3.3.0-family-justice-chat-b11**
- Structured answer contract: **family_answer_v3_3**

## Validation results

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| Full automated suite | **648 passed, 1 skipped; 649 collected** |
| Focused v3.3/chat/intake/package suite | **58 passed** |
| Python compilation | **Passed** |
| JavaScript syntax (`node --check`) | **Passed** |
| Local repository doctor | **Passed; safe_to_push=true** |
| Release artifact audit | **Passed; zero blockers; safe_to_package=true** |
| Public-source readiness audit | **Passed; 1,283 files checked; zero findings** |
| FOCAF printable asset audit | **Passed; 103/103 resolved; zero missing; zero hash mismatches** |
| Package privacy/runtime hygiene | **Passed; no private matter data or runtime state packaged** |

The single skipped test is the existing PowerShell parser check, which reports `PowerShell parser unavailable on this runner`. The full suite was run under Xvfb so the desktop/Tk launcher test executed successfully rather than failing for lack of a display.

## New regression coverage

The v3.3-specific tests prove:

- immediate-safety language outranks served-paper and routine task routing;
- negated service, hearing, danger, and weapon phrases do not create false urgency;
- service, hearing, and possible response/filing dates are labeled by nearby language;
- New Hampshire-law source cards can be reopened without rerunning retrieval;
- ordinal requests select the first, second, or third prior card;
- prior-card state is session-scoped, bounded, short-lived, and fails closed;
- New chat clears/rotates conversation source state;
- long intake is bounded and the truncation is disclosed;
- API responses use no-store/request-ID security headers; and
- internal exception messages and private paths are not returned to clients.

## Scope limits

This is a clean **source-repository** release. The Linux environment cannot rebuild or sign the Windows MSIX and cannot run the Windows App Certification Kit. The Store-safe package target is **3.3.0.0**. Production legal GA remains false until the external official-authority data product, attorney-reviewed gold evaluation pack, measured release thresholds, security/pilot evidence, and required owner signoffs are complete.

## Remaining milestone count

**33 Enterprise GA plan passes remain (Pass 19 through Pass 51).** The repository contains substantial scaffolding and tests for those areas, but the plan correctly requires real external authority builds, attorney-reviewed evidence, operational security validation, controlled pilots, and signoffs before they can be counted as closed.
