# New Hampshire Family Law LLM v3.5.0 Completion Report

v3.5.0 upgrades source transparency and retrieval safety while preserving all v3.4 conversation-continuity and privacy controls.

## Completed

- Added a reusable grounding-integrity assessment layer.
- Distinguished source-backed answers from freshness-verified current-law answers.
- Added authority, freshness, currentness, and support-boundary metadata to every source card.
- Made bundled seed-source limitations visible in the answer, badges, source drawer, API, and reviewer handoff data.
- Fixed direct record searches from the **Both** selector so they finalize as private-record results.
- Improved hearing-date role classification and urgency review flags.
- Expanded prompt/document injection and review-bypass detection.
- Sanitized override clauses before retrieval without rewriting the visible user prompt.
- Added fail-closed behavior when no substantive question remains after sanitization.
