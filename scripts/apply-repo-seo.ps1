# New Hampshire Family Law LLM

Open-source New Hampshire family law AI workbench for legal research, court-form guidance, document review, evidence mapping, citation checking, and review-required drafting.

Built for New Hampshire family-law workflows: divorce, parental rights and responsibilities, child support, protection from abuse, post-judgment motions, contempt, Rule 52 findings, best-interest factors, UCCJEA issues, appellate record problems, and New Hampshire court forms.

This is not legal advice and not a lawyer. It is a local-first, source-grounded legal information and drafting-support tool. Outputs remain review-required unless verified by source, citation, quote-span, fact/evidence, freshness, and human-review gates.

## What is New Hampshire Family Law LLM?

New Hampshire Family Law LLM is a standalone legal AI workbench focused on New Hampshire family law. It helps users research New Hampshire authority, review legal documents, organize evidence, check citations, identify red flags, and produce review-required drafts.

## New Hampshire family-law topics covered

- Divorce
- Parental rights and responsibilities
- Primary residence
- Contact schedules
- Child support
- Parentage
- Post-judgment motions
- Motions to modify
- Motions to enforce
- Motions for contempt
- Protection from abuse
- Protection from harassment
- Grandparent visitation
- Guardianship
- GAL issues
- UCCJEA jurisdiction
- Rule 52 findings
- Best-interest factor gaps
- Appeal preservation
- Transcript and record issues
- New Hampshire eCourts record access
- New Hampshire court forms

## What the workbench can do

- Answer New Hampshire family-law questions with source cards
- Retrieve New Hampshire statutes, rules, forms, and Supreme Court authority
- Review documents for issue labels, posture, red flags, and missing information
- Build timelines and fact-to-evidence maps
- Generate authority matrices
- Check citations and quote spans
- Draft working motions, affidavits, letters, objections, proposed findings, and checklists
- Generate filing-readiness blocker reports
- Keep outputs review-required by default

## What it does not do

- It does not replace a lawyer.
- It does not provide legal advice.
- It does not guarantee filing-ready output.
- It does not treat model memory as authority.
- It does not train shared models on private matter data by default.
- It does not package private files, model weights, vector stores, corpora, OCR caches, or runtime databases in the source repository.

## Source-grounded legal AI, not a generic chatbot

This project prioritizes official New Hampshire authority, verified retrieval, citation verification, quote-span verification, legal review gates, and human review. Source correctness matters more than polished prose.

## Local-first privacy and external data boundaries

Private matter files, corpora, vector databases, embeddings, OCR caches, runtime databases, generated legal work product, and model weights must stay outside the source repository.

## Plain-language description

This repository builds a New Hampshire-specific legal AI workbench. It focuses on source-grounded retrieval, verified New Hampshire authority, citation and quote checking, document review, evidence mapping, and review-required drafting.

The system is not a generic chatbot. It is designed around official New Hampshire family-law authority and legal-safety gates.
