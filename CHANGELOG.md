## 8.0.10 — Pass 8 desktop integration

Added the NH review desk to the production gateway, repaired package resources,
implemented a loopback-only launcher and fixed-view activation, and preserved
source/wheel evidence. No new authority promotions or Windows qualification.

# Changelog

## 8.0.4 - New Hampshire migration Pass 2: authority elimination and replacement

- Reached zero active legacy-authority scanner findings outside explicit provenance/history exceptions.
- Replaced jurisdiction-specific connectors, source IDs, release controls, parser fixtures, legal terminology, and active operator documentation with New Hampshire-native equivalents.
- Added a 40-record NH enterprise source inventory while preserving fail-closed status for all unreviewed sources.
- Corrected New Hampshire launcher/PyInstaller identity and added a current NH Store privacy policy and container data boundary.
- Replaced inherited printable resources with seven generalized NH non-authority planning PDFs.
- Collected 2,598 tests; passed 209 and skipped 1 across a selected 210-test migration/authority/packaging suite; built and import-tested the 8.0.4 wheel.
- Did not claim full-suite, Windows package, attorney review, current-authority acquisition, or exhaustive corpus completion.

## 8.0.3 - New Hampshire migration Pass 1: code repair

- Repaired Python identifiers and missing imports created by the initial jurisdiction rename.
- Added the NH fixture source manifest, NH/federal fetch allowlist, and migration checkpoint tests.
- Restored complete test collection and a focused executable smoke suite.
- Marked this checkpoint as development-only; Maine-authority elimination and replacement remain Pass 2 work.

## 8.0.1 - Reliability and specialist integration safeguards

- Hardened source-bound specialist task instructions, reference validation, worker memory monitoring, and cancellation. Unadmitted model outputs remain blocked.
- Improved authority, evidence review, drafting traceability, production navigation, and local privacy boundaries.
- Confined new Windows build output and caches to repository dist and preserved existing user profiles during unattended runtime checks.
- Added complete sequential regression batches with exact collection-to-result accounting.
- Research adapters remain excluded from the Store package pending passing evaluation and production admission. This release does not claim new admitted New Hampshire-law model weights or organizational Enterprise qualification.

## 8.0.0 - Enterprise-hardened Add-on Studio

- Added twenty complete local-first verticals spanning native transcription, OCR correction, communications, evidence graphs, model admission, forms, tables, finance, order comparison, authority updates, research, annotation, scheduling, reviewer handoff, templates, entity review, notifications, courtroom bundles, voice drafting, and extension permissions.
- Bundled a hash-pinned CPU whisper.cpp 1.9.2 runtime and compact English model for real offline transcription; no runtime download is performed.
- Added tenant enforcement, encrypted artifacts, exact artifact drill-down, append-only review decisions, idempotency, and result/audit-chain integrity verification.
- Verified all twenty through the shipped production UI and a fresh frozen executable using fictional data.

## 7.0.0 - Verified-scope freeze and fail-closed release hardening

- Froze the public source release at 7.0.0 and the Windows package target at 7.0.0.0 while preserving the Microsoft Store identity, publisher, x64 architecture, and `en-us` language.
- Reduced the advertised product to 16 source/frozen-runtime-verified capabilities; slices 21-44 and other incomplete installed workflows remain hidden or development-only.
- Activated an external immutable official-authority generation with direct statute, rule, current form, and New Hampshire Supreme Court opinion records plus exact citation/source-span verification.
- Consolidated final-like exports behind a canonical fail-closed filing gate; the 16-case release attack set produced zero false passes.
- Hardened Local-only networking, matter isolation, untrusted-document handling, privacy, audit integrity, backup/restore, runtime startup, and error-path behavior.
- Built and audited the self-contained 7.0.0.0 x64 MSIX and its packaged local document/OCR/privacy engines without placing private matters or authority products in the package.
- Recorded the v7 Store package as blocked pending clean isolated AppX installation and WACK; no v7 Store certification, publication, attorney validation, controlled pilot, or Enterprise GA is claimed.

## 5.2.0 - Answer-first evidence, guarded drafting, and tracked Word review

- Moved answer-specific evidence into the large main chat response with clickable official links, secure private-record actions, page controls, previews, and copy actions; the evidence rail remains an optional persistent workspace.
- Added an in-app Documents & Drafting workspace with main-chat **Save as draft**, private-record **Draft from record**, a large editor, revision history, structured line diffs, and TXT/Markdown/DOCX exports.
- Added immutable first revisions, optimistic concurrency, one-use confirmation capabilities, explicit commit/delete confirmation, recoverable soft deletion, preserved imported originals, and a hash-chained local audit log.
- Added guarded document API routes for create/list/read/propose/commit/reject/delete/restore/import/export and audit verification. All document content remains local and model output is review-required, not filing-ready.
- Integrated the MIT-licensed `pablospe/docx-editor` engine for hash-anchored paragraph selection, tracked replacements/deletions/insertions/rewrites/comments, and new-copy-only Word output. Original Word records are never overwritten.
- Credited Lê Minh Hiếu/Paparusi for the MIT-licensed document-workspace/action/revision architecture patterns and Pablo Speciale for `docx-editor`; corresponding MIT notices are retained under `licenses/`.
- Hardened the loopback API against DNS rebinding/cross-origin requests, bounded request bodies and record-open cache growth, made capability-token storage thread-safe, and retained dependency/CVE gates. Product version is 5.2.0 and Store package target is 5.2.0.0.

## 5.1.0 - Legal workflow contracts, matter consistency review, and portable knowledge bundles

- Added a dependency-free declarative workflow-skill registry with strict JSON schemas, role separation, dependency validation, bounded manifest loading, and no executable skill loading.
- Added read-only matter-folder inventory with symlink blocking, path containment, optional SHA-256 hashing, supported-format reporting, and resource limits.
- Added conservative many-to-many record classification and cross-document hard-field conflict records with source locations and no automatic legal conclusion.
- Added independent QC contracts with blocker/verify/evidence/authority/stale-law/contradiction/suggestion classes and a hard prohibition on same-run self-approval.
- Added a security-hardened, Apache-2.0-compatible subset inspired by Open Knowledge Format: Markdown concepts, strict frontmatter, stable IDs, indexes, and SHA-256 manifests.
- Added bounded DOCX media extraction and deterministic data-only workflow-skill packaging utilities.
- Added explicit attribution to zeweihan and A-market-ecm-lawyer-plugin contributors, and to GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog. No AGPL, unlicensed, leaked-source, cloud-agent, or credentialed connector code was incorporated.
- The transplanted features add no executable plugin loader or automatic network access. Raised pypdf, pypdfium2, FastAPI, Starlette, Uvicorn, Pillow, and PyInstaller floors/pins to patched current releases; added an offline dependency floor gate, pip-audit CI, and Dependabot. Product version is 5.1.0, Store package target is 5.1.0.0, and UI build is 28.

## 5.0.1 - Universal local source inspection and evidence UX hardening

- Added a secure in-app document inspector for PDFs, images, email messages and attachments, office documents, text/HTML/RTF/JSON, CSV/TSV, ZIP members, and local audio/video.
- Added page navigation for PDFs, image zoom controls, safe email header/body rendering, attachment drill-down, archive-member drill-down, table previews, and text extraction previews.
- Private source cards now expose distinct Inspect, Open original, and Download verified copy actions.
- Record capabilities are random, short-lived, active-corpus scoped, hash verified, and never reveal a filesystem path.
- Active HTML, SVG, XML, and script-like files are never executed in the local app origin.
- Improved focus trapping, Escape/backdrop close, focus return, responsive full-screen inspection, and resize behavior.
- Product version is 5.0.1, Store package target is 5.0.1.0, and UI build is 27.

### v5.0.0 build 26 - source preview and evidence UX hardening

- Added hover/focus source-card previews and click-pinned, scrollable flyouts with keyboard/Escape support.
- Removed nested scrollbars from starter packs and evidence summaries; the parent rail/drawer now owns scrolling.
- Anchored the Local only/Offline tooltip to the viewport-safe edge so status text no longer clips.
- Added source-card-to-record-token binding using opaque active-corpus tokens only.

## 5.0.0 - Premium family-justice workbench UI

- Rebuilt the desktop workbench around a modern three-column layout matching the approved v5 design: primary chat, persistent research shortcuts, and an integrated Evidence & tools panel.
- Added a deep-navy FOCAF identity header, local-only status, top-level role/style/topic/context controls, matter access, and a clearer source-lane composer.
- Preserved local corpus, OCR, legal-source, private-record drill-down, reviewer handoff, printables, privacy, keyboard, and transcript workflows.
- Made the Evidence panel desktop-persistent by default while retaining a dismissible mobile drawer.
- Added responsive layout, accessible focus states, clearer typography, compact record/source cards, and v5 UI regression coverage.
- Hardened responsive resizing across full desktop, compact desktop, tablet, phone, and short-window layouts with no horizontal page overflow.

- Added dynamic viewport sizing, mobile control consolidation, reduced-motion and forced-colors support, and short-height composer compaction.
- Bumped product version to 5.0.0 and Microsoft Store package target to 5.0.0.0.

## 4.5.0 - Private-record chat cards, clickable drill-down, and record open security

- Replaced plain-text "Relevant record slices" with grouped, deduplicated clickable drill-down cards in chat responses.
- Cards group by source document, attachment/member, page, and normalized snippet; show safe filename, document type, match count, page list, and a short snippet.
- Added working Open PDF, Open at page N, and Show all matches actions rendered directly inside chat responses using opaque one-time tokens.
- Implemented secure loopback `/api/records/open/{token}` endpoint: rejects forged, stale, cross-corpus, missing-file, traversal, and hash-mismatch requests.
- Verified ZIP member, email attachment, PDF, and non-PDF preview opening without exposing absolute paths or using file:// URLs.
- Removed generic legal boilerplate from records-only searches; a text match is never treated as a legal conclusion.
- Added comprehensive regression tests: card rendering, clickable links, duplicate collapse, correct file/page opening.
- Bumped version to 4.5.0 / 4.5.0.0.

## 4.4.0 - Windows startup, one-click OCR prerequisites, and corpus-command reliability

- Fixed the Windows launcher path quoting defect that could raise `Illegal characters in path` from `.NET GetFullPath()`, including generated Start, Verify, and Repair launchers.
- Added explicit one-click Tesseract installation through Windows Package Manager, manual-install fallback links, installer status polling, and a local recheck action.
- Bundled `pypdfium2` for local scanned-PDF rendering so a separate Poppler or MuPDF install is not required.
- Routed commands such as `find PDF re: contempt` to PDF-filtered private-record search and `list what is in my indexed corpus` to an actual inventory response with counts and record cards.
- Preserved local-only document handling, review-required output, and Store-safe package version `4.4.0.0`.

## 4.1.0 - Three-pass retrieval, drafting, and runtime integrity hardening

- Added exact New Hampshire citation/form/rule recognition and transparent retrieval-quality diagnostics.
- Added conservative source diversity and duplicate-suppression reporting without representing retrieval rank as legal correctness.
- Added structured review-required drafting that separates legal authority from private records and rejects bypass-only prompts.
- Added privacy-safe runtime self-checks, full FOCAF resource verification, atomic local service state, stale-PID kill protection, and prior-manifest replacement in deterministic ZIP builds.
- Preserved local-only matter handling, Store-safe revision zero, and fail-closed GA boundaries.

## 3.8.0 - Three-pass input, claim-support, handoff, and release hardening

- Added local request integrity normalization for Unicode spoofing controls, null/control bytes, size limits, and opaque session/search identifiers.
- Added conservative claim-to-source diagnostics surfaced in the structured answer and browser, with stale, jurisdiction, current-law, unsupported, and contradiction blockers.
- Added reviewer-safe source-card projections that omit private excerpts and absolute paths by default, plus confirmation before complete private transcript exports.
- Added a deterministic full-source ZIP builder with sorted entries, fixed timestamps/permissions, embedded SHA-256 manifest, symlink rejection, and runtime/private/model exclusions.
- Corrected source ZIP auditing to permit only the product's bundled public FOCAF PDF paths while continuing to block arbitrary PDFs.
- Preserved local-only matter handling, review-required output, Store-safe revision zero, and all prior source/freshness controls.

## 3.5.0 - Grounding integrity, currentness transparency, and retrieval sanitization

- Added a machine-readable grounding-integrity contract that distinguishes source presence from current-law verification, claim support, and filing readiness.
- Annotated every legal and private-record card with authority, freshness, currentness, and support-capability metadata.
- Fixed direct record-search routing from the Both lane, improved hearing-date classification, and added date review flags.
- Expanded prompt/document injection coverage and removed matched override clauses from retrieval queries while preserving the original transcript and safety review.
- Added fail-closed handling when no substantive legal question remains after prompt sanitization.
- Preserved local-only private records, review-required outputs, Store-safe revision zero, and all prior v3.4 continuity/security controls.

## 3.4.0 - Safe continuity, source follow-up correctness, and instruction boundaries

- Fixed a browser runtime error in reviewer handoff rendering that could replace a successful chat answer with a visible error.
- Routed source-card follow-ups through the session-isolated server so ordinal and lane-specific requests open the correct cards without rerunning retrieval.
- Added bounded, raw-text-free structured conversation anchors for explicit short follow-ups; safety, dates, docket numbers, court names, and raw questions are never inherited.
- Replaced stale source-card reuse after an ungrounded turn with fail-closed latest-answer state.
- Added instruction-like text detection and trust-boundary metadata for prompts and retrieved private records without altering original snippets.
- Added disclosed year inference and relative-date normalization, request limits, and sanitized background OCR errors.

## 2.07.0 - v1.0.0 full-record corpus-builder upgrade

- Added universal full-case corpus builder, local-first evidence intake, privacy-filtered external releases, role-specific GAL/court/lawyer/prosecutor packages, question-coverage audits, source-hash verification, and one-click launcher/self-builder workflow.
## 8.0.6 — 2026-09-11

- Added first current-verified NH authority capsule snapshot for RSA 458-C, 461-A, 161-C, and 458-A.
